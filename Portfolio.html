                    <p class="main-content-text">This is basically just a blog for me to not only rant about the death of the manual gearbox but also the prevelence of the automatic gearbox in high-performance cars. How has this come to pass? There are many factors, principle of which is that high-performance cars are a lot more accessible now and regular people who may have found them hard work are now taking an interest. </p>

                        <p class="blog-text-paragraph">Should we as car enthusiasts be worried about this? Well, yes and no. On one hand we should be thankful about the fact that high-performance cars are becoming more accessible. More people are buying them and consequently more development money is being spent making the cars faster and more reliable. As a knock-on effect, lots of other cool stuff like tyre technology gets more development mileage as well as manufacturers take things more seriously as well.</p>

                        <p class="blog-text-paragraph">I suppose where we should really worry is that most of that aforementioned development capital being spread out across many different components and this very much includes gear boxes. Many performance car manufacturers are no longer producing manual gearboxes at all where previously this was all they made. McLaren, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Pagani, Koenigsegg have all bowed out. Even more disheartening is the fact that the open-gate gearbox has also been killed-off. So where does this leave us manual bores? We pretty much have to grin and bare it. Andreas Preuninger has recently announced that he need at least 10% of new 991.2 GT3s to be manual to justify keeping it for the next generation and he seems hopeful rather than confident that this will materialise. </p>
